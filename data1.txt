Dear Bhupeshhhh,

Thank you for being not only the love of my life but also my best friend. Your unwavering support, love, and ability to make me laugh even on the hardest days mean everything to me. You are my rock, my confidant, and my biggest cheerleader.

I am so grateful for the little things you do—whether it's the thoughtful ways you show you care or the moments we share just being ourselves. You make life brighter, and I can't imagine this journey without you by my side.

Here’s to love, friendship, and the beautiful bond we share. Thank you for being you.
