Dear Kasturiii,

I don’t say it enough, but thank you for being my rock, my cheerleader, and my constant source of joy. Your unwavering support and love mean the world to me, and I’m so grateful for every moment we’ve shared—whether it’s the laughter, the adventures, or the times you’ve simply been there when I needed you most.

You have a way of making everything brighter, and I can’t imagine my life without you in it. Thank you for being you, for always having my back, and for filling my life with so much love and positivity.

Love always,
Pratikshaaa
